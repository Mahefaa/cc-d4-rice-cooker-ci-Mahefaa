# Rice Cooker CI

## Description
* This re-implements [rice-cooker-assignment](github.com/hei-school/my-rice-cooker-Mahefaa) because it has only one branch and is some sort of unfinished work.

* My Rice Cooker CI is supposed to be an integration of [Circle CI](circle-ci-link) with the aforementionned work.


## Features ðŸš€
### As it is an implementation replacement of the rice cooker assignment, actual needed features will be under the CI-Features tag( CI - Features)

These are the actions you can make with this program:

1. plug a rice cooker in
2. unplug a rice cooker
2. increase rice amount by 1cup
3. increase water level by 1L
4. decrease rice amount by 1cup
5. decrease water level by 1L
6. cook rice (needs water)
7. boil water ( does not need rice)

### CI - Features
unit tests documentation per branches will be put here later on.
